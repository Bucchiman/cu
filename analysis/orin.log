[06/13/2023-18:21:30] [W] [TRT] TensorRT encountered issues when converting weights between types and that could affect accuracy.
[06/13/2023-18:21:30] [W] [TRT] If this is not the desired behavior, please modify the weights or retrain with regularization to adjust the magnitude of the weights.
[06/13/2023-18:21:30] [W] [TRT] Check verbose logs for the list of affected weights.
[06/13/2023-18:21:30] [W] [TRT] - 219 weights are affected by this issue: Detected subnormal FP16 values.
[06/13/2023-18:21:30] [W] [TRT] - 139 weights are affected by this issue: Detected values less than smallest positive FP16 subnormal value and converted them to the FP16 minimum subnormalized value.
